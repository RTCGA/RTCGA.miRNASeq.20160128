# RTCGA.miRNASeq.20160128 

This package was created with [`RTCGA::createTCGA()`](http://rtcga.github.io/RTCGA/staticdocs/createTCGA.html) function and is a part of [RTCGA](http://rtcga.github.io/RTCGA/) project. It consist of
data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas Project](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga). 

Datasets existing in this package were downloaded automatically from [Firehose Broad GDAC](http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/) portal. They were taken
from the 2016-01-28 release date. All release dates are available [here](http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/runs/). Datasets were downloaded with the use of `RTCGA::downloadTCGA()` function and were transposed with `RTCGA::readTCGA()` function.

The package contains following datasets, which names corresponds to: the cohort type, data type and release date. Cohort types can be checked
with `RTCGA::infoTCGA()`, release dates with `RTCGA::checkTCGA('Dates')` and data types with e.g. `RTCGA::checkTCGA('DataSets', 'BRCA')` calls. 
The used data type for this package was ` illuminaga_mirnaseq__bcgsc_ca__Level_3__miR_gene ` - all those information are included in the `DESCRIPTION` file. To see
the manual page for included datasets run  `?miRNASeq.20160128` in R console.

Optionally, the data can be loaded through the [ExperimentHub](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.4/bioc/vignettes/ExperimentHubData/inst/doc/ExperimentHubData.html) interface.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ExperimentHub)
eh <- ExperimentHub()
myfiles <- query(eh,  "RTCGA.miRNASeq.20160128" )
myfiles[[1]]  ## load the first resource in the list
```


# Installation 

To install this package from GitHub use
